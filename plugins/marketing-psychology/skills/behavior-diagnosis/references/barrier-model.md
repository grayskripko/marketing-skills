# Barrier model

Two lenses, used in this order: first the quick motivation-ability-prompt check, then (in behavior-diagnosis) the fuller COM-B map.

## 1. Motivation, ability, prompt (L27)

A behaviour happens when the person is motivated enough, finds it easy enough, and gets a prompt at that moment. Name the binding barrier, the one that would change the outcome most if removed, and quote the input that shows it.

| Barrier | Signs in the input | Typical fixes |
|---|---|---|
| Ability (friction) | many fields or steps, unclear next step, jargon, setup needing another person, waiting, surprise costs | remove steps, pre-fill, plain words, show time needed, let the user hand a task to a colleague |
| Motivation | outcome vague, no proof for the reader's situation, risk not addressed | concrete outcome (result, time, who), real proof, risk reversal that is true |
| Prompt | no reminder or call to action at the moment the user is able to act | a prompt at that moment (in-app, email after the trigger event) |

Check in this order: ability (count the friction), then prompt, then motivation. The binding barrier is the first one that fails, backed by a quote or a count.

Friction first: when ability is the binding barrier, fix it before adding persuasion (L32). Count friction from the input: steps, fields, decisions, waits, unknowns. Write "not stated" when the input does not say.

## 2. COM-B map (L28)

| Component | Plain question | Evidence to quote |
|---|---|---|
| Psychological capability | Do they know what to do and how? | confusion quotes, help tickets, drop at an explanation step |
| Physical capability | Can they physically do it (physical skill or stamina)? Rarely the barrier in software | physical limits |
| Physical opportunity | Does the environment allow it (time, tools, access, devices, permissions, money)? | "needed IT", wrong device, missing integrations, price |
| Social opportunity | Do people around them support it? | team approval, norms in their role |
| Reflective motivation | Do they believe it is worth it? | doubts about value, risk |
| Automatic motivation | Do habit and feeling pull them towards it or away? | anxiety, habit of an old tool |

Tag every barrier "observed" (cite the step count or a few words of the quote) or "assumed" (state what would confirm it: a count to pull, or one exit question at the drop step). In the answer, name barriers in plain words, not by component.

## 3. Intervention functions

Links used in this plugin, adapted from the Behaviour Change Wheel (L28). Coercion and restriction are excluded by rule: this plugin does not suggest penalties or removing options to force a behaviour.

| Barrier | Functions to consider |
|---|---|
| Psychological capability | education, training, enablement |
| Physical capability | training, enablement |
| Physical opportunity | environmental restructuring, enablement |
| Social opportunity | environmental restructuring, modelling, enablement |
| Reflective motivation | education, persuasion, incentivisation |
| Automatic motivation | persuasion, incentivisation, training, environmental restructuring, modelling, enablement |

Persuasion and incentivisation suggestions still need the "legitimate only if" fact and a register check.

## 4. Step rates with a Wilson 95% interval (L30)

For k successes out of n, with p = k/n and z = 1.96:

```
centre     = (p + z²/(2n)) / (1 + z²/n)
half-width = z × sqrt(p(1-p)/n + z²/(4n²)) / (1 + z²/n)
interval   = centre ± half-width
```

Print in plain words with one decimal, rounding half away from zero: "600 of 1,000 opened setup: 60.0% (95% range 56.9–63.0%)". Use the host's code tool when one is available; otherwise work it by hand and show the inputs, with no remark about how it was computed. Below n = 30, add "small sample". Write "n not given" for a rate without a denominator. Compare two segments only when both have counts, and then by the interval for the difference (Newcombe: with d = p1 − p2 and each rate's Wilson interval [l, u], low = d − √((p1 − l1)² + (u2 − p2)²), high = d + √((u1 − p1)² + (p2 − l2)²)), not by whether the two intervals overlap. Never turn a step rate into a lift prediction.
